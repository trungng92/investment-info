# Summary

This repository contains information about investments that I think is interesting.

For example:

- the effects of compounding interest (in finances)
- the benefits of investing in a 401k vs a Roth IRA vs a brokerage account
- investment agencies vs index funds
- the benefits of frontloading vs monthly contributions

## How much money does a 401k build up?

When calculating 401k returns, the important thing to consider is that the market grows 9% a year (which is 7% after taking inflation into account), so any money you invest now doubles in 10 years:

```
Growth rate: 1.07 ^ 10 == 1.96715135729
```

So if you put in $100 now, you will have $200 in 10 years, $400 in 20 years, etc. This may not seem like much, but as you constantly invest more money, your investment fund will snowball.

This is a spreadsheet that shows how much money a 401k account (and match contributions) + Roth IRA account accumulates over the course of 20 years.

A few noteworthy items:

- By maxing out your 401k and Roth IRA, you will have $1,000,000 in 17 years.
- Assuming you max your contributions, at 20 years, your investment returns will gain almost $100,000 a year on its own.

## What is the best way to invest your money?

I believe in the words of [Jack Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle).

Basically, don't invest in individual stocks/markets, invest in the market as a whole, and time in the market is more important than timing the market.

## Is it better to frontload your investments or average it out?

When investing in the market, the two generally suggested strategies are:

- averaging (which means if you're going to invest $12,000 a year, then you invest $1,000 a month and spread out your investment over the whole year)
- frontloading (which means if you're going to invest $12,000 a year, then you put all $12,000 in at the beginning of the year)

The [`investment-strategies`](investment-strategies/README.md) is a tool to test various investment strategies and see their theoretical gain.
